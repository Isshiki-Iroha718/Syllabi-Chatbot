Information Security Management MASY1-GC 3220-100| Fall 2022 | 9/02/2022 - 12/09/2022 | Fridays | 3 Credits Modality: In-Person Course Site URL: https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/196061 General Course Information Name/Title: Anthony Candeias, Adjunct Instructor NYU Email: adc7@nyu.edu Class Meeting Schedule: 9/02/2022 - 12/09/2022 | Fridays / 2:00 pm - 4:35 pm ET Class Location: Room:1021 Loc: Midtown Center Office Hours: By appointment, please email to make one.  Description  This course focuses on the importance of protecting data and information in today's digital world as related to strategy and policy, awareness, data classification, ownership and accountability, monitoring, and reporting. The course covers network components that comprise the environment, where the data are input, processed, and stored, and how the data travel through the Intranet, Extranet, and/or Internet. Upon completion of the course, students learn to assess the impact of data in the digital world, considering the steps that the Government, Corporations, and the Private Sector take to protect information assets. Students gain an understanding of components that comprise network security and how each component provides protection. They become familiar with preventative and detective tools such as anti-malware, ACL, virus protection, cryptography, intrusion detection, audit logs, and logical and physical controls and perform information risk assessments. Prerequisites 1240 - Information Technology and Data Analytics  Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:  Apply the key principles of information security to the value of data and technologies in the digital world  Analyze different security frameworks used by Government, Corporations, and the Private Sector to protect digital asset  Design a digitally secure environment to protect business information assets  Justify how each digital security component provides protection from threats  Support the decision to select and use preventive, detective, and responsive security elements  Perform information security risk assessment to quantify and address high-risk occurrences Communication Methods Be sure to turn on your NYU Brightspace notifications and frequently check the “Announcements” section of the course site. This will be the primary method I use to communicate information critical to your success in the course. To contact me, send me an email. I will respond within 24 hours.   Credit students must use their NYU email to communicate. Non-degree students do not have NYU email addresses. Brightspace course mail supports student privacy and FERPA guidelines. The instructor will use the NYU email address to communicate with students. All email inquiries will be answered within 24 hours. Students have the opportunity to add their pronouns, as well as the pronunciation of their names, into Albert. Students can have this information displayed to faculty in Albert, Brightspace, and other NYU systems. Students can also opt-out of having their pronouns viewed by their instructors. https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/forms-policies-procedures/change-of-student-information/pronouns-and-name-pronunciation.html  Structure | Method | Modality This course is in-person and will meet once a week on Friday. NYU Brightspace is the learning management system we will use.  Active learning experiences and small group projects are key components of the course. Assignments, papers, and exams will be based on course materials (e.g., readings, videos), lectures, and class discussions. Course sessions will be conducted synchronously on NYU Zoom, which you can access from the course site in NYU Brightspace.   This course is and will meet once a week on Friday, with assignments, announcements, and emails being sent through Brightspace. Zoom is the remote instruction platform used at NYU. Students are expected to check email and/or Brightspace at least twice a week for announcements concerning assignments, class changes or cancellations, and other important information. The course will involve lecture/discussions/forum discussions as well as case studies. Two major papers/projects are required that will both be done on an individual basis. Expectations Learning Environment You play an important role in creating and sustaining an intellectually rigorous and inclusive classroom culture. Respectful engagement, diverse thinking, and our lived experiences are central to this course and enrich our learning community.  Participation You are integral to the learning experience in this class. Be prepared to actively contribute to class activities, group discussions, and work outside of class.  Assignments and Deadlines  Students are expected to complete individual readings and complete independent assignments during the course.   Frequent and high-quality participation and notes for the in class discussions is required  Readings, individual papers, teamwork, and class discussions will be assigned and graded weekly.  The final case project will be announced at the beginning of the course, and it will be due by the end of the last class.  ○ The purpose of the project is to provide students with a hands-on experience with the intricacies, complexities, planning, meeting requirements, making presentation, and project reporting. Having completed the project, students are required to submit a final essay, and prepare a presentation, which includes a deck of the project and its expectations.  All team members should contribute to the group projects. Submit a single paper (pdf or doc) for the team identifying which team member contributed to which part of the case. Include your team number, team members, and date, type each question and answers, and include in text and end references in the APA style. The team cases will be evaluated on both an individual and group level.  ○ More details will be provided. All essays are to be written in the APA style.  Please refer to the Course Outline below for Readings, Class Assignments, and Cases.  Please review the Grading Policy below.   Course Technology Use We will utilize multiple technologies to achieve the course goals. I expect you to use technology in ways that enhance the learning environment for all students.
