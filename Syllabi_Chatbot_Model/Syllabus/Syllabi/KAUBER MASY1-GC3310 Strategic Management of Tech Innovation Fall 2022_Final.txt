Description  This course prepares students to meet the demands of strategic planning in a technology-driven organization. It addresses optimizing the R&D (Research and Development) cycle, smooth transition from design to production, innovation streams, and integration of technology with business strategy. Focusing on case studies, students learn real-world technology decision-making strategies, including allocation of resources, managing complex technology initiatives, and management of technology teams. The course examines the role technological innovations play in the competitive dynamics of industries and the use of metrics to evaluate new product effectiveness and innovation performance. Students create individual proposals for applications of technological innovations to address business needs. Prerequisites N/A Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:   Apply innovation concepts to the management of technological innovation   Apply analysis tools to determine the success potential of applying an innovation   Apply an emerging technology to create economic benefit for an organization    Design intellectual property protection strategies for the created innovations    Create metrics to increase the success rate of technological innovation application projects  Communication Methods Be sure to turn on your NYU Brightspace notifications and frequently check the “Announcements” section of the course site.

Zoom is the online instruction platform used at NYU. Brightspace is the learning management system we will use for assignments, announcements, and emails. Students are expected to participate in all class sessions including in class work using a laptop or tablet computer. They are expected to check Brightspace, and their NYU email accounts at least once every day for changes to course meetings and/or assignments, how and when students will meet for class sessions or group work, whether the course will involve lecture or discussion, team projects, and so forth.  Students will develop a solid foundation in the strategic management of technological innovation by first understanding the industry dynamics of technological innovation, then learning how to formulate a technological innovation strategy, and then practicing its implementation. Most importantly they will also understand and have confidence in what they know and what else they need to know to practice at a higher professional level. Prior to starting the course, students should be able to:   Understand the basics of probability, statistics and decision–making   Quickly search for, identify and then retrieve high-quality information   Use Microsoft Word to write briefing reports, study guides, papers, etc., including citations and references in APA style, according to a predefined specification   Use Microsoft Excel to analyze data, prepare tables and charts and insert them into documents Active learning experiences and small group projects are key components of the course. Assignments, papers, and exams will be based on course materials (e.g., readings, videos), lectures, and class discussions. Course sessions will be conducted synchronously on NYU Zoom, which you can access from the course site in NYU Brightspace.  Expectations Learning Environment You play an important role in creating and sustaining an intellectually rigorous and inclusive classroom culture. Respectful engagement, diverse thinking, and our lived experiences are central to this course and enrich our learning community.  Participation You are integral to the learning experience in this class. Be prepared to actively contribute to class activities, group discussions, and work outside of class. It is required that students attend all classes and are part of the group case studies that will take place in class. Each student is expected to contribute to the in-class discussions. Each session will require students to read the case studies prior to that session. Each student is required to contribute her or his own ideas, opinions and feedback during group discussions of the case study. To better facilitate discussion and student engagement, the class might be divided into groups for case analysis. Note that these groups will not remain static and will change during the semester.    There will be 2 individual assignments on the specific topic(s) covered in the related classes.    There will be 2 team case studies on the specific topics selected by the instructor.    There will be a final case study centered on the specific industry selected by a team of students where students will design a plan for technological innovation, perform the study, and present the findings. This is intended as a team exercise but based on individual interest could be an individual project.   Length of Assignments and Cases (excluding cover page and end reference page) o Assignments should be between 400 and 600 words  o Case Studies should be between 600 and 800 words    Length of Final Case Study (excluding cover page and end reference page) o The final case study should of the length sufficient to present feasible innovative solution to the problem.    Late Submissions o Assignments submitted late will not be accepted. Students shall submit their assignments via Brightspace.  Assignments and Deadlines Students are expected to complete individual readings and complete independent assignments during the course. Frequent and high-quality participation in class discussions is required. Readings, individual papers, teamwork, and class discussions will be assigned and graded weekly. The final case project will be announced at the beginning of the course, and it will be due by Class 14. The purpose of the project is to provide students with a hands-on experience with the intricacies, complexities, planning, meeting requirements, making presentation, and project reporting. Having completed the project, students are required to submit a final report, and prepare a presentation, which includes a deck of the project and its expectations. All team members should contribute to the case studies. Submit a single paper (pdf or doc) for the team identifying which team member contributed to which part of the case. Include your team number, team members, date, type each question and answers, and include in text and end references. The team cases will be evaluated on both an individual and group level. More details will be provided.  Please refer to the outline provided by the professor for Readings, Class Assignments and Cases. Please review the Grading Policy below. Submission of Deliverables Delivery occurs when a student’s work is available on the Brightspace Assignment folder for the course. In the rare situation when a student believes they cannot meet a scheduled delivery date they should immediately contact the instructor and request for a modified delivery date. The request may or may not be granted depending on its content and the reason for not meeting the deadline. If granted, the student will receive a written agreed new delivery date (Notes: VERBAL DOESN’T COUNT, and there is a 50% penalty per day for reception of your work beyond the originally ASSIGNED or AGREED NEW DUE DATE) Course Technology Use Most class sessions are planned to be in person, but any necessary remote sessions require use of Zoom. All class sessions require a network device such as iPad or Laptop with audio capabilities to participate in the classes. We will use Zoom technology for any online sessions. Each student will be required to perform research, type the assignments, and submit them to the instructor via NYU’s website.
