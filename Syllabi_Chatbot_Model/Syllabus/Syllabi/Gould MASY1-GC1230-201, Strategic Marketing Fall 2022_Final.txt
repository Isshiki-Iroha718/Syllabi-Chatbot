Contact me via email to make an appointment. Description  This course provides a thorough understanding of the strategic marketing process, from analyzing customer needs, to developing products and services, integrated communications, taking them to market, order fulfillment, and successfully managing customer relationships. Topics include the marketing mix and the holistic marketing concept, marketing research and forecasting, environmental analysis, market segmentation, customer relationship management, brand equity, managing marketing programs, integrated marketing communications, online marketing, and return on marketing investments. In this course, students explore and analyze marketing strategies that are integrated across the organization and its customer touch points, the communications mix across distribution channels, and the customer lifecycle. They also learn how to optimize the core processes of the value chain, analyze the competitive environment, develop, and execute an integrated marketing communications mix, and formulate and implement marketing strategies for acquiring and retaining customers. Prerequisites N/A Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to: • Propose marketing alternatives applying emerging and traditional marketing approaches • Differentiate between a customer-centric vs. a product-centric structure. • Evaluate optimal target markets to maximize customer relationships • Manage a product through its life cycle of product development and global marketing • Construct marketing plans and projects and evaluate results using appropriate marketing and communications B2C, B2B, and not-for-profit approaches Communication Methods Be sure to turn on your NYU Brightspace notifications and frequently check the “Announcements” section of the course site. This will be the primary method I use to communicate information critical to your success in the course. To contact me, send me an email. I will respond within 24 hours. PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE SUBJECT OF EMAIL YOU SEND TO ME: “Strategic Marketing - 201” Students must use their NYU email to communicate. Brightspace course mail supports student privacy and FERPA guidelines. The instructor will use the NYU email address to communicate with students. All email inquiries will be answered within 24 hours. Students have the opportunity to add their pronouns, as well as the pronunciation of their names, into Albert. Students can have this information displayed to faculty in Albert, Brightspace, and other NYU systems. Students can also opt out of having their pronouns viewed by their instructors. https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/forms-policies-procedures/change-of-student-information/pronouns-and-name-pronunciation.html  Structure | Method | Modality This course is Online (Sy) and will meet once a week on Wednesday. We will use the Brightspace learning management system. Zoom is the online instruction platform used at NYU. All students should attend the course on time on the days we meet each week. You are expected to check email and/or NYU-Classes daily for announcements concerning assignments, exam dates, class changes or cancellations, and other important information. Sessions will be comprised of lectures by the Professor, robust, interactive class discussions and working with the “Mimic” Marketing Simulation. Subject matter lectures, the “Mimic” Marketing Simulation, PowerPoint presentations, video cases   and course pack materials will be used to illustrate principles and stimulate thinking. All course assignments are listed in the syllabus. There is one group project in this course. Explicit details will be provided. Students will gain insight and understanding about how to plan marketing campaigns and will test their learning by interacting with the Mimic Marketing Simulation throughout the course. Frequent quizzes will help students and the Professor assess progress. Expectations Learning Environment You play an important role in creating and sustaining an intellectually rigorous and inclusive classroom culture. Respectful engagement, diverse thinking, and our lived experiences are central to this course and enrich our learning community.  Participation Participation means engaging productively to the discussion versus simply speaking in class or offering a random comment in the online forum; it also means actively listening and building on the questions and discussion points of your classmates. As graduate students, you are expected to conduct yourselves in a professional manner and engage and collaborate with your classmates. 1. Class participation will be used in determining a student’s final grade. Students are expected to participate in Discussion Forums throughout each week. 2. Class participation is a vital part of the learning process for this class. Students are expected to be prepared to discuss the planned-for material as well as to participate in class activities and group activities “outside” of class as described in and inferred by this document. Students must be prepared to present their required presentations on-time – there can be NO EXCEPTIONS to this requirement. Our schedule is too tight to allow for leeway 3. Grade may be impacted for each full or partial class session missed.  Assignments and Deadlines See matrix at the bottom of this syllabus Course Technology Use We will utilize multiple technologies to achieve the course goals. I expect you to use technology in ways that enhance the learning environment for all students. All class sessions require use of Zoom. All class sessions require use of technology (e.g., laptop, computer lab) for learning purposes. IT Service Desk (212)-998-3333 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Email: AskIT@nyu.edu Zoom Support • NYU Zoom Guide for Students • Make sure you are using NYU Zoom to log-in for class • Check the NYU Zoom site often for updates. (To update Zoom, you can also open from your desktop and click menu, then “Check for Updates.”) Brightspace Support • Log-in to the Brightspace platform or visit the Student Training website. • Video on how to Navigate the Bright Space Learning Environment  Feedback and Viewing Grades I will provide meaningful feedback on all your papers via our course site in NYU Brightspace. You will receive immediate assessment of your online work on the Stukent website.  Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions. Excused absences are granted in cases of documented serious illness, family emergency, religious observance, or civic obligation. In the case of religious observance or civic obligation, this should be reported no later than the first week of class. Recruiting activities, job interviews and incompatible travel plans, for example, are considered unexcused absences even if notification is given in advance. Unexcused absences from sessions can have a negative impact on your final grade since you will miss important direction and instruction about how to complete the then current section of your marketing plan. Students are responsible for assignments given during any absence. Students are expected to keep cameras on and remain visible throughout each class. Mute microphones unless speaking. Each unexcused absence may result in a student’s grade being lowered by a fraction of a grade (+/-) for example, from a B to a B-. A student who has three unexcused absences may earn a Fail grade. University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays: https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies- guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/university-calendar-policy-on-religious- holidays.html The course format requires students to attend class consistently, be prepared to participate in the presentation process, and participate in evaluating peers. Missing more than three class sessions can, at the discretion of the Professor, be cause for the student to have to drop the course or receive a grade of “F.” Students will receive credit for attendance only when they arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Students may enter class late or leave class early only if given permission by the instructor and if it can be done without disrupting the class. Class standing for students who miss more than one class session will be subject to review. Entering a class “late” constitutes ½ of a class session missed. Students who join the course during add/drop are responsible for ensuring that they identify what assignments and preparatory work they have missed and complete and submit those per the syllabus. Refer to the SPS Policies and Procedures page for additional information about attendance.

Since all graded assignments are related directly to course objectives and learning outcomes, failure to complete any assignment will result in an unsatisfactory course grade. All written assignments are to be completed using APA format and must be typed and double-spaced. Grammar, punctuation, and spelling will be considered in grading. Please carefully proof-read your written assignments before submitting them for a grade.  You will automatically be graded online for textbook quizzes and all assignments you are to complete for the Mimic Simulation. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REDO ANY OF THE ONLINE QUIZZES AND ASSIGNMENTS SO CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR WORK PRIOR TO SUBMISSION. IMPORTANT: It serves no purpose to complete online assignments in advance of their due date. History has shown that students who prepare the work prior to the stated due date often earn a lower grade because they did not have the advantage of correlating their assignments with the class activities designed to supplement student knowledge. I have provided a Grading Guide for each paper you will prepare for this course. Your grade for each paper you will prepare will reflect how well your work conforms to the expectations set forth in the Grading Guide for the paper. I will attach a completed Grading Guide to the beginning of each paper you submit, showing the grade you earned. The paper will then be uploaded to your personal assignments folder on Brightspace. It is possible to receive a paper where I did not include the grading guide. Instead, you will find written comments and the grade you earned at the beginning of the paper. I will make every effort to return papers within one week after you submit them. There are times when I cannot meet this schedule. In such cases, I will return the papers as soon as I can finish grading them. You will earn an individual grade for the work you do on the Group Assignment. Each member of a group could potentially earn a different grade. Grading for a Group Assignment reflects the work you personally did to help the group effort.
